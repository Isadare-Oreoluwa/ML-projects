## Introduction  
Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! This repository features a range of machine learning applications, including predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, and data-driven insights. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and extracting actionable insights.

## Featured Projects  

### Predicting Agricultural Trade Flow Between Nigeria and Its Trading Partners  
- *Description:* A comprehensive project leveraging machine learning techniques to predict agricultural trade flows between Nigeria and its key trading partners. This project explores how factors such as agricultural import/export values, GDP, population, and other features influence trade patterns. By analyzing data from 1996 to 2021, the project provides actionable insights to enhance Nigeria's agricultural trade policies and competitiveness. 
- *Key Highlights:*  
  - *Dataset:* Trade data spanning 1996â€“2021 from 70 trading partners across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas.
  - *Machine Learning Models:* Linear Regression (with Ridge and Lasso variants), Random Forest, Gradient Boost Regression, Neural Networks.  
  - *Results:* Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy with an R-squared of 75% for import predictions.
               Identified key features driving trade flows, such as GDP and population of trading partners, exchange rates, and distance.
