## Introduction  
Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! This repository features a range of machine learning applications, including predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, and data-driven insights. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and extracting actionable insights.

## Featured Projects  

### Predicting Agricultural Trade Flow Between Nigeria and Its Trading Partners  
- *Description:* A comprehensive project leveraging machine learning techniques to predict agricultural trade flows between Nigeria and its key trading partners. This project provides insights into how factors like exchange rate volatility and trade openness impact trade patterns.  
- *Key Highlights:*  
  - *Dataset:* Trade data spanning 2010â€“2020, featuring variables like export volumes, trading partners, and exchange rates.  
  - *Machine Learning Models:* Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for predictive analysis.  
  - *Results:* Achieved a predictive accuracy of 85% and identified critical factors influencing trade.  
- *Report:* [Detailed Report](https://github.com/Isadare-Oreoluwa/ML-projects/blob/main/Projects/Agricultural-Trade-Flow-Analysis/Report.pdf)  
- *Code and Data:* [Download Files](https://github.com/Isadare-Oreoluwa/ML-projects/blob/main/Projects/Agricultural-Trade-Flow-Analysis/Data.zip)
